the Guardian    Once ticket-holders arrive at a rally, each potential voter is instantly given the opportunity to go from fan to oath-taker: the volunteers hand out supporter cards, encouraging

people in Trump T-shirts were representing the campaign at a summer fair in Davis County \u2013 a rural, remote jurisdiction with less than 10,000 people on the Missouri border.", "\u201cFoot soldiers of the Republican Party in Iowa resent Donald Trump going around them and directly to individual voters, many of whom have not been active or participated in the past,\u201d said Jamie Johnson, a longtime Republican activist in the state who worked on Rick Perry\u2019s failed campaign.", "Jeff Kaufmann, the chair of Iowa\u2019s Republican party, said the Trump operation amounted to a
